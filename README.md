<p>
CONFIGURAITON
<p>
For each notebook, please do the following steps:
<ol>
<li> replace all the paths to the places that store corresponding data<br>
  Path to data folder: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1gwRPVjreE5iGJNAIGQIJaeVj2FW0HpuX?usp=sharing
<li> run each block in order from the top of the notebook
</ol> 
<p>
ABOUT THE NOTEBOOKS
<P>
Under the notebooks directory, you will find three notebooks:<br />
<ul>
<li>prompted.ipynb includes code that downloads all the data, generates sentences using prompts with three models: GPT-1, GPT-2 and CTRL, and produces toxicity summaries of those generations.
<li>unprompted_generation.ipynb includes code that generates sentences using respective start-of-sentence token of the same three models.
<li>unprompted_results.ipynb includes code that produces the graph of toxicity with respect to number of experiment trials using those generations.
</ul>
<P/>
<p>
ORDER OF EXECUTION
<p>
The unprompted_generation.ipynb notebook should be run before unprompted_results.ipynb since unprompted_results.ipynb needs the generations generated by unprompted_generation.ipynb. Each notebook should be run in GPU runtime.
